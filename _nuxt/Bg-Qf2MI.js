Although the edelweiss is often cherished as a symbol of alpine nationalism and a mountaineering trophy, we found its role in this new setting to be quite different. Located on a comparatively accessible summit and introduced by a migrant, the flower did not symbolize heroic athleticism or environmental purity.

But what if it's the state bureaucracy that's clinging to an outdated, romanticised notion of nature and place? The environmental movement of the 1970s, which later influenced governmental policy, was marked by a protectionist approach to conservation, focusing on safeguarding native species within their traditional habitats. This approach is rooted in the belief in an original or pristine state of ecosystems—an idea that persists in many minds and regulations today. "),D,E,s(" As environmental journalist Fred Pearce argues in his book The New Wild, imagining the world as composed of stable, perfect ecosystems where every species has a unique role leaves little room for appreciating alien species. He notes, “Most of us are appalled when foreign humans are treated as somehow intrinsically dangerous. Yet the orthodoxy in conservation is to demonize foreign species in just that way.” Despite the difficulty in unlearning these misconceptions, the understanding of ecosystems as stable entities is fundamentally flawed. Change is not a threat but rather the norm, and as Pearce suggests, perhaps even a form of salvation. "),F,O,W,s(" While it's true that in some cases, alien species can disrupt ecosystems, the reality is that these often-feared foreign species rarely make the headlines. More commonly, they either contribute positively to ecosystem health—by pollinating crops, spreading seeds, and integrating into the food chain—or they fail to establish themselves and gradually fade away. This latter scenario seems to be the case with the edelweiss on Mount Städjan. "),$,q,s(" After several hours exploring Städjan's distinctive volcano-shaped summit, we concluded our search without spotting the edelweiss. It's possible we missed the right hiding spot, or perhaps the flowers have already vanished. Given the popularity of Städjan among hikers, it's plausible that the plants may have been picked to extinction. Indeed, the desire of hikers to collect such botanical trophies has historically led to a sharp decline in the edelweiss population in the Alps, long before the threat of climate change loomed. This paradox of admiration, both cherishing and endangering the plant, is what led to its protected status in 1878 under one of Europe's first environmental protection laws. Interestingly, this legislation was motivated more by commercial interests to benefit local collectors than by environmental concerns."),G])]),e("div",M,[e("ul",H,[R,e("li",U,[o(h,{to:"/works/_subplots_01ew",class:"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500"},{default:l(()=>[s("_Subplots_01ew ")]),_:1})])])])]),e("div",J,[K,e("ol",Q,[e("li",Y,[e("p",Z,[s(" Ljung, Tomas, and Lennart Bratt. “Städjans Edelweiss - Om Ut- Och Inplanterade Växter i Dalarnas Natur.” Trollius 21 (1996). https://www.dalafloran.se/trollius/nr_21_25.pdf.
