But what if the state bureaucracy is\nthe one clinging on to a romantic idea of nature and place? The 1970's environmental\nmovement, including its later expression in governmental policy, was characterised by\nprotectionism: an approach to conservation that emphasises the protection of\nindividual species within environments where they're considered to belong. The\nidea leans on the conception of the existence of an original or pristine state\nof ecosystems; an idea that still lingers in many minds and regulations.\nAnd as environmental journalist Fred Pearce states in his book the New Wild, when we\nimagine the world as made up of tightly knit ecosystems that are perfect and\nstable, where every species has evolved to have a unique roll, there is little\nroom for any appreciation for alien species. Despite how hard it is to unlearn, the understanding of ecosystems\nas stable and balanced is wrong. Change itself is not the threat but rather the baseline, or as\nPearce would pose it, perhaps even a salvation. While it's true that in some instances\nalien species cause havoc to ecosystems, the dull reality is that most of the\ntime often-feared foreign species don't make the headlines at all. They rarely\noutcompete local species, instead they usually either become incorporated as contributors\nto the overall health of ecosystems: pollinating crops, spreading seeds, and positively\nmingling with native species in the food chain. Or they fail to properly\nestablish themselves and gradually cease away, which seems to be the case with\nthe edelweiss on Mount Städjan."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After a few hours of surveying the\ncharacteristic volcano-shaped summit we eventually packed in without a glimpse\nof the flower.
